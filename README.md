# Uniform-Grid-CFD-Field-Database-for-L-DED-Second-Law-Analysis-UG-LDED-2025-
The Uniform-Grid L-DED Second-Law Field Database (UG-LDED-2025) contains time-resolved, three-dimensional numerical snapshots generated from a high-fidelity thermo–fluid–phase-change simulation of laser directed energy deposition (L-DED). All datasets are exported on a uniform Cartesian mesh and include temperature, velocity, metal-volume-fraction fields, volumetric heat-source density, and five surface heat-flux channels. These quantities enable fully reproducible evaluation of conductive and viscous entropy generation, exergy input, interface complexity, energy-path accounting, and deposition-effectiveness metrics. The database serves as the sole numerical foundation of the proposed second-law framework, providing a rigorous, cross-comparable, and machine-independent field benchmark for modelling irreversibility and thermal-energy utilisation in L-DED systems.
